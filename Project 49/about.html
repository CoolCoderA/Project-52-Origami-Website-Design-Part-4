Hi I'm Ananya, and I love art, basketball, astronomy, and dogs. 
I'm not a fan of math, but sometimes I do find it interesting. 
I  created this fun and educational website so bored kids and adults can make cool origami animals and learn about them!
Thanks for visiting! I hope you enjoy this website!
